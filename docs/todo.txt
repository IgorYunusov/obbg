Possible tasks to work on next:

   Networking:
   -  client-side prediction
      -  client replays last K inputs relative to server update data
   -  test network lag, dropouts
   -  server sends sparser updates
   -  server tracks multiple physics regions, one per player
   -  client interpolates between recent server updates
      - and extrapolates if necessary?!?
   -  replace SDL_Net with a lighter-weight #define socket wrapper
      - http://gafferongames.com/networking-for-game-programmers/sending-and-receiving-packets/
   *  client transmits last N inputs
   *  server buffers M inputs from client

   Look prettier:
   -  add skylight
   -  more work on terrain -- zmc pseudo-wang tile approach
   -  fix depth fighting when far from origin
   -  dynamically set view distance
   -  improved height-field terrain 
   -  other terrain features
   -  texture improvements
     -  tweak pixar textures to be more grey so can dynamically recolor
     -  find better open textures or pay someone to make them
   -  add better lighting
   -  use more block types

   Performance:
   -  limit mesh cache to max size
   -  optimize mesh building
   -  optimize terrain generation

   Voxel features:
   -  disk save/load
      - lz4 compression?
   -  user block create/destroy (needs raycast?)
   -  networking

   Game features:
   -  object system
   -  object (non-terrain) rendering
      - what model-file format?
      - animation? skinning?
      - procedural animation of characters?
   -  fix walking physics
      - push smoothly along walls
      - smooth camera height when stepping up
      - don't stick to walls when falling one block
      - core physics model should steer existing momentum to new direction instead of being so Newtonian
   -  physics representation (1 bit per block? run-length? 1-byte min, 1-byte max, bits within that range?)
      - 1 byte length
      - 1 byte type
   -  raycast (needs physics rep)
   -  shoot guns

   Code quality
   -  check for memory leaks

Not right now:

   -  check "voxel_world_vheight_spiky.avi" for terrain inspiration
